# lxqt-themes-arc

This repository contains the Arc and Arc-Dark themes for LXQt, as well as the associated color schemes (palette files).

If using the Openbox window manager, which is the default on X11/Xorg, it might be useful to install the <a href=https://www.box-look.org/p/1017533/>Arc-Openbox</a> themes by user "arcbox" for a more consistent look.
